# Memo - Statement of Goals
#### Feb. 4, 2019

This project will focus on the materials produced by the Russia-based news outlet, RT. First, I will build a web-scraper to collect the organization's output. Then, I will analyze that collected data in a historical context, looking at trends in the organization's coverage. As a final step, I will revisit the original program to add the future-facing ability to continually update its database, then build out a new tool to track trends in RT's reporting as they emerge. This final step will have particular relevance in the 2020 elections, allowing reporters to see in real time what themes RT focuses on and what it interjects into the national discourse.

The goals for this semester's project are to learn the technical skills necessary to build a web scraper and analyze the data gathered.

_Completion Timetable_
* Phase 1: Spring break
* Phase 2: Spring semester end
* Phase 3a: Summer 2019
* Phase 3b: Fall semester end

## Phase 1: Build RT Scraper

_Learning Goals_
* Learn the technical skills necessary to:
  * Build a web scraper and associated database
  * Analyze the data gathered

_Deliverables_
* A web scraper deployable to RT.com that will sensibly gather and store articles and their associated metadata
* A database of scraped RT articles that can be mined for analysis

## Phase 2: Historical Analysis

_Learning Goals_
* Practice mining natural language
* Use mined data in a story
* Portfolio: Newsworthy findings based on analysis, preferably incorporated into a story

_Deliverables_
* Statistical information about themes present in RT America's articles from 2015 to the present (details TBD based on exploratory analysis and needs of JOUR-628N)

## Phase 3: Add Updating Feature and Build Ongoing Tool

_Learning Goals_
* Update the scraper with the ability to update a database on a schedule
* Portfolio: Useable tool for the industry

_Deliverables_
* a. Updated version of the RT scraper that can update a database on a schedule without re-scraping old information
* b. Ongoing, real-time tool of newsworthy value: to track trends in RT's reporting and determine what is being injected into the discourse or given focus
